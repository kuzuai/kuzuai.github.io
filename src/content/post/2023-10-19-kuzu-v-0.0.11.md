We release K첫zu 0.0.11, another minor release. The main new feature of this release is read-only access mode for the database on Linux. The read-only mode enables the upcoming [K첫zu UI](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu-ui) to optionally open a database in read-only mode while allowing other applications to access the same database concurrently.

For more detailed information about the changes in this release, please see [here](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/tag/v0.0.11).
