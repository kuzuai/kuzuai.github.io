## Performance and scalability improvements
### Recursive joins
Our recursive joins has been heavily reworked for better scalability and performance.

#### Overview

#### Performance characteristics

### Spill to disk during COPY REL
This feature allows intermediate data during COPY REL to be spilled to a temporary file on disk when the buffer manager runs out of memory.
With this feature, we can ingests large dataset into the system with limited RAM.
For example, xxx

The default path of spilling is `copy.tmp` file under the database directory. You can change the path by `CALL spill_to_file_tmp_path='new_tmp_file'`. Set the path to empty turns the spilling off.

The spilling only works with local file system, and is disabled under in-memory mode.

### Floating point data compression
We have now integrated a new compression algorithm, ALP ([Adaptive Lossless floating-Point Compression](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626717)), for floating point data into the system.

// TODO: 1) brief introduction of ALP. 2) Show some micro benchmarks on db sizes.

### Zone maps


### Filter and projection pushdown to relational database scan

## Features and usability improvements
### JSON data type
We now have native supported JSON as a data type in the system.

### Allow skipping erroneous rows during COPY
In this release, we continue to improve the usability of our COPY statements.
Erroneous rows in CSV and JSON files are known as annoying to handle. Having the ability to skip those erroneous rows can greatly improve the usability of COPY.
By specifying `IGNORE_ERRORS=TRUE` in a COPY statement, we can skip rows that trigger exceptions while continue ingesting all other rows. Detailed error messages and skipped rows can be viewed through `show_warnings()` function.

More details can be found in our [docs](https://docs.kuzudb.com/import/csv/) 

### CSV sniffing

### Attach remote DuckDB

## Golang API
We've added the support for Golang! You can start building applications using Go by checking out our documentation  [here](https://docs.kuzudb.com/client-apis/go/).
