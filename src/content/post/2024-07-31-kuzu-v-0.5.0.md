It's been a productive summer for Kùzu Inc., and we are really excited to announce the release of
Kùzu **0.5.0**! In this post, we'll describe a host of new features, improvements and extensions that
are available to users in this major release. Without any further ado, let's dive in!

## Features

### Remote databases

User can now attach a remote Kùzu database through `httpfs` extension and use it as if it is a local database. This release has limited attached database to be read-only.

E.g.
```
ATTACH 's3://kuzu-example/university' AS uw (dbtype kuzu);
```

### Python UDFs

We have extended UDF implementation to Python API.

To register a python UDF, user needs to provide both function signature and implementation

```python
# define your function
def difference(a, b):
    return a - b

# define the expected type of your parameters
parameters = [kuzu.Type.INT64, kuzu.Type.INT64]

# define expected type of the returned value
return_type = kuzu.Type.INT64

# register the UDF
conn.create_function("difference", difference, parameters, return_type)
```

Once registered, python UDF can be used as a regular function

```
RETURN difference(2, 1)
```

### Direct scan from Polars, PyArrow & SQLite

In the previous release, we introduced direct scan of DataFrame, Postgres database & DuckDB database. This release further extends this feature to 

To scan Polars
```python
import polars as pl

df = pl.DataFrame({
    "name": ["Adam", "Karissa", "Zhang"],
    "age": [30, 40, 50]
})

res = conn.execute("LOAD FROM df RETURN *")
print(res.get_as_pl())
```

To scan PyArrow
``` python
import pyarrow as pa

pa_table = pa.table({
    "name": ["Adam", "Karissa", "Zhang"],
    "age": [30, 40, 50]
})

res = conn.execute("LOAD FROM pa_table RETURN *")
print(res.get_as_arrow())
```

To scan SQLite, first install sqlite extension.
```cypher
INSTALL sqlite;
LOAD EXTENSION sqlite;
```
Attach a sqlite database.
```cypher
ATTACH 'university.db' AS uw (dbtype sqlite);
```
Scan from attached database.
```cypher
LOAD FROM uw.person RETURN *
```

### Json
This release adds Json support through extension. User can now directly scan and ingest data through a json file. It is also possible to store json natively as data type in Kùzu.

To scan a json file
```
LOAD FROM 'data.json' RETURN *;
```

To ingest data from a json file
```
CREATE NODE TABLE tab(a INT64, b STRING[], c DATE, PRIMARY KEY (a));
COPY tab FROM 'data.json';
```

Query result can also be exported in json format
```
COPY (match (t:tab) return t.*) TO 'data2.json';
```

Json can also be used as a regular data type in the system. To define a table with json column
```
CREATE NODE TABLE tab(id INT64, col1 JSON, PRIMARY KEY id);
```

### Data types

#### Decimal
User can now represent floating point numbers with `DECIMAL` data type when exact precision is required. Decimal data type is defined as `DECIMAL(precision, scale)`, where `precision` is the total number of digits and `scale` is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

#### User-defined types

User can also create their own data type through an existing data type, e.g.
```
CREATE TYPE BIGINT AS INT64;
CREATE NODE TABLE Person (id BIGINT, name STRING, age BIGINT, PRIMARY KEY(id));
```

### Others

#### Create sequence

On top of `SERIAL` data type, we add `SEQUENCE` whose range and step can be cutomized in the create statement. The following example shows how to create, read and update a sequence
```cypher
CREATE SEQUENCE Seq INCREMENT 1 MINVALUE 1 NO MAXVALUE START 1;
RETURN nextval('Seq');
RETURN currval('Seq');
```

#### Create table if not exists
By default, Kùzu throw an exception when trying to create a table whose name already exists in the database. User can use `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid confliction. E.g.
```cypher
CREATE NODE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS UW(ID INT64, PRIMARY KEY(ID));
```

#### Drop table if exists
Similar to the above case, user can drop table only if it exists. E.g.
```cypher
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS UW;
```

#### List lambda function
We added three list lambda functions
```cypher
RETRUN list_transform([1,2,3], x->x+1);
RETURN list_filter([1,2,3], x->x>1);
RETURN list_reduce([1,2,3], (x,y)->x+y) 
``` 

#### Progress bar in CLI and Kùzu Explorers
For long running queries, user can enable progress bar through
```
CALL progress_bar=true;
```

Progress bar is currently available in CLI and explorer.

#### C-API improvements
We made several improvements over C APIs in this release.

- Replace return values with out parameters, simplifying object reuse.
- Make functions that may fail now return a kuzu_state value, streamlining error handling. 
- Add data type utility functions such as `kuzu_date_t`, `kuzu_timestamp_t`, and `kuzu_interval_t`.

## Performance improvements

### MVCC

Version 0.5.0 of Kùzu brings numerous updates and improvements to the multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) protocol.

#### INT128 compression

### Hash index

### Remote file system system cache

## Closing Remarks

As always, we have only scratched the surface of listing the many new features and improvements in Kùzu v0.5.0 in
this blog post. For a more comprehensive list, check out our [release notes](https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu/releases/tag/v0.5.0)
